OrthoNazi 0.1
=============

An IRC Bot to insult people who make orthography mistakes

1.) Requirements:

  - irc (http://bitbucket.org/jaraco/irc/)
  - aspell (http://http://0x80.pl/proj/aspell-python)

2.) Usage:

Create a bot script like so:

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import orthonazi

    servers = [('irc.server.com', 6667)]
    bot = orthonazi.OrthoNazi(servers, channels=["#mychannel"], delay=600, whitelist_path="./whitelist.txt")
    bot.start()

Refer to the source for more options. Without 'whitelist_path', the whitelist will be discarded between runs.
Use 'delay' to change the grace time between insult messages.

If you want ipv6 or SSL you have to pass the appropriate factory from the irc lib, like

    import irc.connection
    ...
    bot = orthonazi.OrthoNazi(servers, channels, ...,
          connect_factory = irc.connection.Factory(ipv6=true))
